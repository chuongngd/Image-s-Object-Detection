# Image's Object Detection
## Abstract
The application uses TensorFlow Object Detection API and Flask Python to create an application for image detection. User input image and the object detection algorithm will return the objects in the image. All the images and objects will be saved into the database. The application also detect objects from stream video, and capture the stream video with its object.

## Funtionals Requirements
The application will implement user registration module, login module, and object detection module. 
The application separate presentation layer, business layer and database layer. 
The application separates the view (jinja2 templates) and the controllers. 
The application uses TensorFlow Object Detection API to detect imageâ€™s objects.
The application use relational database MySQL. 
The application is deployed on Flask server and localhost. 


## Logical Solution Design
The solution divides the application to Controller (Python site) and View (Jinja2 templates). The server side includes a Flask server and TensorFlow Object Detection API.

## Physical Architecture
The Flask server, TensorFlow Object Detection API, and MySQL database are hosted and demo on localhost (Windows OS CPU 2.2GHZ x 8GB GPU x 16 GB RAM x 16 GB Storage).
